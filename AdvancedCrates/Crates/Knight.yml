Animation: Knight
#It is recommended to copy the crate file of which crate you wish to edit, as some animations have unique to them configurations
Proximity_Distance: 8 #How close to the crate does the crate disappear for the user(not including the crate opener)
AnimationVisibilityOption: "Proximity"
# What should be the settings for animation see-ability?
# "Individual" - Only the opener of the crate sees the animation.
# "All" - Everyone sees the animation.
# "Proximity" - if a player comes too close to the crate (distance set with Proximity_Distance configuration) the animation disappears (except for the opener of the crate),
# Otherwise everyone can see the animation. Useful so multiple people can open crates at the same time and still see what other players are receiving
#OnlyPlaceableAtLocations: #This makes it so users can't place down crates anywhere expect in these coordinates
#  - "-270,78,-2"
